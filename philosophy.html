            <h1>Why The Honest 5?</h1>
            <p>
                In a world where Google stars and Beli ratings all seem to hover around a confusingly small range of values, it becomes tough to cut through the noise and find restaurants that stand out above the crowd. I think we deserve a better way of finding out if a place we found is going to be worth our time and money, so I hope to make it here.
            </p>
            
            <h1>My Food Rating Philosophy</h1>
            <p>
                2’s and 8’s are exceptional, 1’s and 9’s should be exceedingly rare, and 10’s change lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                The middle of any rating scale is where it gets really hard to decide rankings, but this is where it matters the most in my opinion. There are two extremely useful questions that I ask myself when reviewing somewhere:
            </p>
            
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Next time I look for a restaurant in that category, would I choose to come back here or try somewhere new?</li>
                <li>Was that a worthwhile exchange of that amount of money for that experience?</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
                The answer to the first question almost always informs the most important categorization: greater or less than the honest 5. To me, an above average place is one I would enjoy going back to more than, statistically speaking, I would enjoy a different random restaurant in its category*.
            </p>
    
    
    
            <p>
                The answer to the second question tends to only shift my rating by maybe one or two, but it can be a very tricky adjustment to make. On one hand, there is some sense of explicit value in food and drink, but there is also so much that goes into enjoying a meal that has nothing to do with the exact ingredients in the dish. After all, eating at a restaurant is an experience and some part of your bill goes towards that experience. Thus, the second question essentially is asking whether that premium you paid on top of the ingredients used to physically make your dish was worth it. This is really the point where expensive restaurants tend to lose points, and cheap restaurants tend to make them up.
            </p>
    
            <small class="footnote">
                * If I would choose this place a second time when looking for something similar, then by necessity my subconscious thinks it is below average. This is based on the idea that there are practically infinite restaurants in New York City that I have not tried and the average of all of those will be, given that assumption, 5. So, if I would rather try somewhere new then I have necessarily assumed my odds of finding a better place is greater than 50% (this does assume a normal distribution of restaurant rankings).
